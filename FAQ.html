                                    between the first and second dose of the vaccine. You will be contacted when it is

                                    everyone, even if they have received the vaccine.
                                    It is also extremely important that people continue to seek testing for COVID-19 if

                                        categories during specific weeks starting March 8 and onwards.</li>
                                    <li> Due to the size of the vaccination effort, some hold times will be inevitable.
                                        As
                                        such, we appreciate everyone’s patience as we all work together to book the next
                                        eligible groups for their vaccination.</li>
                                    <li>Unless you are in the listed age group or are an advocate or family member

                                        for someone in the age group, please do not phone the call centre.
                                        If you call before you’re eligible to do so, it will just prevent someone who is
                                        eligible from getting through to the call centre.</li>
                                    <li>Anyone who is looking for information on when they are eligible can visit
